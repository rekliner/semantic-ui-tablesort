# semantic-ui-tablesort
The tablesorter plugin for semantic ui in repository form so it can be included through npm/yarn.  From https://semantic-ui.com/javascript/library/tablesort.js as documented here: https://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html#sortable

This provides a better solution than including the file directly...which is the only other option Semantic-UI currently provides.

# Installation
run:
`npm install git+https://github.com/rekliner/semantic-ui-tablesort.git `
or via ssh:
`npm install git+ssh://git@github.com/rekliner/semantic-ui-tablesort.git `

or add directly to your package.json:
`"symantic-ui-tablesort": "git+https://github.com/rekliner/semantic-ui-tablesort.git",`

# quibbles
The lack of a package to include was brought up in [Sematic-Ui issue # 6433](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6433) and the need was dismissed.  They've moved on to focus on their React version and the original framework is drifting towards abandonment.
